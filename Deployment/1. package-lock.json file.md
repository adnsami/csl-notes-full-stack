## Dependency Hell

“Dependency hell” is a common headache for developers—it describes the situation wherein you attempt to update a single piece of software and end up in a downward spiral of chaos.

Imagine you’re updating the logging framework in your app to the latest version to take advantage of a new feature. As soon as you do, your HTTP client library stops working because it needs an older version of the logging library. Or worse, your project compiles, but your tests fail with a cryptic NoSuchMethodException.

It’s like trying to update your phone only to discover that some of your favorite apps no longer work with the new OS. 

## SemVer

X.Y.Z
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

- Bug fixes not affecting the API increment the patch version, 
- Backward compatible API additions/changes increment the minor version
- Backward incompatible API changes increment the major version.

We call this system “Semantic Versioning.”

- pre-alpha, alpha, beta, release candidate (rc)

alpha version is tested by internal testers or developer only, while beta software is distributed for community testing (including group of external people or users).

## package-lock.json

anytime npm updates your node modules directory it updates package-lock.json at the same time.

- ^: most recent minor versions (any compatbale changes allowed)
- ~: patch versions

npm install
	- if package-lock.json exists, it prefers package-lock.json
	-
npm update 
	- to update all packages
	- ignores package-lock.json, uses package.json
	- at the same time, updates package-lock.json


* package.json and package-lock.json must be commited to the repository.

```bash
npm ci
```
