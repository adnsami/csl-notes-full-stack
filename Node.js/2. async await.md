async await: syntactic sugar (syntaxtically pleasant to work with)

### **1. Macro-tasks**

- Macro-tasks (or just "tasks") are **scheduled operations** that occur outside of the current execution context.
- Examples of macro-tasks:
    - `setTimeout`
    - `setInterval`
    - `setImmediate` (Node.js only)
    - I/O operations (e.g., file system reads, network requests)
    - UI rendering events

#### Behavior:

1. A macro-task is added to the **macro-task queue**.
2. After the current execution stack is cleared (synchronous code finishes), the event loop picks one macro-task from the queue and executes it.
3. Once the macro-task finishes, the event loop moves to the **micro-task queue** before processing the next macro-task.

### **2. Micro-tasks**

- Micro-tasks are **higher-priority tasks** that are executed immediately after the current execution stack is cleared and **before any macro-task**.
- Examples of micro-tasks:
    - `Promise` callbacks (`.then`, `.catch`, `.finally`)
    - `MutationObserver`
    - `queueMicrotask` (explicitly adds a micro-task)

#### Behavior:

1. A micro-task is added to the **micro-task queue**.
2. Once the current execution stack finishes, all micro-tasks in the queue are processed before moving on to macro-tasks.

---

### **Execution Order in Event Loop**

1. **Synchronous Code**:
    - Executes first.
2. **Micro-tasks**:
    - All queued micro-tasks are executed before moving on to the next macro-task.
3. **Macro-tasks**:
    - One macro-task is picked and executed. Then, the event loop returns to micro-tasks and repeats the process.

## async await

async await comes to make life easier from promise hell (promise chain)

```js
const getSomething = async () => { // returns promise of something


} // () => Promise<void>
```

an sync function always returns a promise.

```js
async function func() {
    return 10;
}

func().then((resolve) => console.log(resolve));

```

multiple async functions runs parallelly
