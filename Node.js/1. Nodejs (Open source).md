- js was not capable of handling server side part, for instance quering in database, handling server side request and response, read or write file on server. it was meant for client side 
- ryan dahl in 2009
- nodejs is a server side javascript runtime envirionment that includes v8 engine, built-in apis (for instance: file system i/o, networking, and http requests)
- doesn't have access tot he window object



- node.js runs on single thread which makes it easier to handle up to 10,000 concurrent requests
- all blocking i/o tasks (for instance: database access) are always being processed asynchronously by internal threads without interrupting the main thread.
- for highly CPU-intensive tasks, it is advisable to use worker threads


## ExpressJS

It simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs by providing a set of tools and features to handle HTTP requests, responses, middleware and templating (template engines: pug, ejs, handlebars).


## Node.JS Code

```bash
npm init
or,
npm init -y
```

/*
    - starts the server
    - make it listen for incoming requests on the specified port
    - keeps running the server

## Server

* webs server
* file server
* applicaion server
* database server
* auth server

## API

An API is a general term for a set of rules and mechanisms that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.

**Types of APIs**: APIs can be of different types, such as:

- **REST APIs** (Representational State Transfer)
- **SOAP APIs** (Simple Object Access Protocol)
- **GraphQL APIs**
- **WebSocket APIs**
- **Library/SDK-based APIs** (e.g., APIs provided for a specific programming language or framework).

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. REST APIs are stateless, meaning that each request is independent of any other request.  


## Request Object

- request query string (req.query)
- parameters (route paramerters) /user/:id
- body
- http headers, and so on

## Response Object

- res.send()
- res.json()
- res.status(), res.sendStatue()
- res.set(), and so on

```js

res.set('Content-Type', 'text/plain');

res.set({
	'Content-Type': 'text/plain',
	'Content-Length': '100',
});
```

## API Best Practices


REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is a software architectural style created by Roy Fielding in 2000 to guide the design of architecture for the web.

Any API (Application Programming Interface) that follows the REST design principle is said to be RESTful.

Simply put, a REST API is a medium for two computers to communicate over HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), in the same way clients and servers communicate.


1. Use JSON as the Format for Sending and Receiving Data
	- To ensure the client interprets JSON data correctly, you should set the Content-Type type in the response header to application/json while making the request.

2. Use Nouns Instead of Verbs in Endpoints
	- https://mysite.com/getPosts or https://mysite.com/createPost ❌
	- https://mysite.com/posts 

3. Name Collections with Plural Nouns
	- https://mysite.com/post/123 ❌
	- https://mysite.com/posts/123 (ALLOW DELETE, PUT OR PATCH)

4. Use Status Codes in Error Handling
	* [[See Example]]

5. Use Nesting on Endpoints to Show Relationships
	* https://mysite.com/posts/postId/comments
	* You should avoid nesting that is more than 3 levels deep as this can make the API less elegant and readable.

6. Use Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination to Retrieve the Data Requested
	* https://mysite.com/posts?tags=javascript

7. Use Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination to Retrieve the Data Requested
8. Be Clear with Versioning
	* https://mysite.com/api/v1/
9. Provide Accurate API Documentation
	* Swagger, Postman

## ENV FILE

`.env.local`: Local overrides (should be ignored by git)

Vite uses a specific naming convention for environment variables:
- Must start with `VITE_` prefix
- Example: `VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com`

! put it in the root directory
