Firebase-related APIs use API keys only to identify the Firebase project or app, not for authorization to call the API (like some other APIs allow). Authorization for Firebase-related APIs is handled separately from the API key, either through Google Cloud IAM permissions, Firebase Security Rules, or Firebase App Check. This is why it's OK to include Firebase API keys in your code when you use them only with Firebase-related APIs.

- using .env in front-end is only for github issues. that only keeps them from ending up in a repo. when you build, everything in the env ends up in the front-end code.

NOTE: Just to be clear, CORS does not tell the backend what domains to accept requests from. It tells the browser what domains it can share resources between. It is NOT a security feature for the backend to filter requests from specific domains. It is purely a browser policy. It's pretty easy to find a scenario whee a browser rejects a request due to cors settings yet still have postman hit the endpoint just fine.

NOTE: Anything done in the browser can be replicated outside of the browser.

1. CORS
2. RATE LIMIT BASED ON IP
