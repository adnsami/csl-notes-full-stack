The term "closure" originates from **mathematics** and **functional programming**, where it describes a function that "remembers" the environment in which it was created. JavaScript, influenced by functional programming concepts, adopted this idea.

The inner function essentially "closes the door" on the outer scope, keeping the captured variables locked inside.

A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives a function access to its outer scope. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment (a data structure) within which that function was declared.

### Example 1



```js
function func() {
    let num = 100;

    // console.log('hello from func ', num);
    function childFunc() {
        console.log('hello from child func', num);
    }

    return childFunc;
}

const cf = func(); // cf is the closure. here cf is holding the reference to the instance of the function childFunc
cf();

```

* The instance of `childFunc` maintains a reference to its lexical environment, within which the variable `num` exists.
