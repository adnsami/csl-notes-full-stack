## JS

- JS is a single threaded (one thing at a time), non blocking, async concurrent langauge.
- It has a call stack, an event loop, and a call back queue + other APIs (for instance: setTimeout, fetch Web API)
- V8 is the JS rutnime which has a call stack and a heap
- The heap is used for memory allocation and the stack holds the execution context
- DOM, setTimeout, XML HttpRequest don't exist in V8 source code


I have:
- a call stack
- an event loop
- a callback queue
- and some other apis and stuffs  


### Call Stack

call stack a data stcuture which records where in the program we are

a mechanism (one thread, one call stack, one piece of code at a time) by which the js  engine keeps track of funcitons calls ina  program.

### The Event Loop

- JS has a looping algorithm which is respoinsible for executing the code, collecting and processing event, and executing queued sub-tasks
- The event loop pushes the tasks from the task queue to the call stack

- heap: memory where variables, functions are stored.
- call stack: where actual code lies (thread of execution )
- heap + call stack : execution context

Solution?
asynchronous callbacks

setTimeout(function cb() {
	console.log('there');
}, 0)
